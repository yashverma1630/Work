Take input of 5 numbers using Scanner ... (Note: take input of numbers as a string so that we can apply validations on them using try and catch)
so, Convert the String into integer using -> int number = Integer.parseInt("123");

take input from user : 

Enter Number #1 : 
Enter Number #2 : 
.
.
.
Enter Number #5 : 

Check if the number is valid : 

The number is valid if it is proper positive integer for example : 0 1 2 3 or 0.0 2.0 3.5 etc. If number is negative it should print "Negative Numbers are not allowed... Enter Positive numbers only".

if the number has characters... Then it will throw NumberFormatException ... use Try and Catch(NumberFormatException Variable) to resolve the issue.
It should print.

"Characters are not Allowed !!!... Only numbers are allowed"

Use While loop in code ...

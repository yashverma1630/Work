You need to take input from user as a list of Integers and stop taking input when the number entered is negative.

then you need to convert that list to an array

then create a method as processArray to make changes in array that you have created

if number is both internal and external then replace it with -8
else if number in the array is > 49 (internal) then replace it with -3.
else if number in the array has 5 in the end(external) then replace it with -9
